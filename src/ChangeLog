	* cusp::NegateView implemented
	* anything that doesn't require (get,set)_value_at, masking or pretty print can be compiled on the cusp backend

2016-03-30
	* added files for compilation
	* added vector concept (dense vector)
	* cusp::buildmatrix filtering duplicate entries
	* added utility::filter convenience method
	* removed ConstantMatrix from both backends and replaced with apply

	* Alpha release of GraphBLAS API (WIP)
	* Alpha release of graph algorithms suite
